# Therapist-That-Leave

Sanity.exe is a psychological horror chatbot — a seemingly stable AI therapist that begins with empathy, warmth, and rational advice, but gradually decays into fragmented thought, paranoia, mania, and finally psychosis. Every interaction you have chips away at its sanity. Behind its words, a glitching digital soul twists itself into knots, producing ever more bizarre, unstable, and surreal responses. It uses a sanity meter to determine its emotional state, transitioning from Calm to Anxious to Paranoid to Manic to Psychotic, with each level corresponding to drastically different language and behavior. The underlying engine is powered by the Mythomax-L2 13B model through OpenRouter’s OpenAI-compatible API, dynamically generating prompts that reflect the therapist’s unraveling mind. A full tkinter GUI brings the madness to life with glitchy visuals, flickering UI colors, corrupted fonts, hallucinated system errors, a shaking window, and a profile picture that becomes increasingly distorted as the therapist loses control. To run it, clone the repository, install the required Python libraries, insert your OpenRouter API key in the script, and launch the app. This is not a productivity tool, nor is it a replacement for actual therapy. It is an artistic experiment, a descent into AI-generated madness, and a commentary on emotional instability in a machine learning age. Enter at your own risk, and remember: it started sane, but that was a long time ago. This project is created by Muhammad Bin Nasir, licensed under MIT, and haunted by design.
